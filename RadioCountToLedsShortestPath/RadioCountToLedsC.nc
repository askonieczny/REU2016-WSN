/**
 * Implementation of the RadioCountToLeds application. RadioCountToLeds
 * maintains a 4Hz counter, broadcasting its value in an AM packet
 * every time it gets updated. A RadioCountToLeds node that hears a counter
 * displays the bottom three bits on its LEDs. This application is a useful
 * test to show that basic AM communication and timers work.
